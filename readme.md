# Intel SMI kernel module

I had to change the old intel smi kernel module a bit to compile and load under a ubuntu 64bit 3.13 kernel. 

If someone else needs this too, feel free to try this module. It compiles with a bit of warnings, but it loaded okay, and i could do what I needed (syscfg -bldfs - resetting the BIOS to the defaults).
